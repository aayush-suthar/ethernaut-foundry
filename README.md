## 01 - Fallback
**Difficulty:** 1/5  
**Vulnerability:** Broken Access Control / Insecure Logic in `receive()`

### Analysis
The contract allows any user to become the `owner` by satisfying two conditions in the `receive()` function:
1. `msg.value > 0`
2. `contributions[msg.sender] > 0`

### Exploit Path
1. Call `contribute()` with a small amount of ETH (< 0.001 ETH) to satisfy the second condition.
2. Send a low-level transaction with 0 data and 1 wei to trigger the `receive()` function.
3. Call `withdraw()` as the new owner to drain the contract.

### Execution
```bash
forge script script/01-Fallback.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast
```

## 02 - Fallout
**Difficulty:** 1/5  
**Vulnerability:** Insecure Initialization / Constructor Naming Typo

### Analysis
In Solidity versions prior to `0.4.22`, a constructor was defined as a function sharing the exact name of the contract. The developer intended to restrict initialization upon deployment but introduced a typographical error (`Fal1out` instead of `Fallout`). Consequently, the EVM compiled this intended constructor as a standard, state-mutating `public payable` function, leaving the initialization logic fully exposed.

### Exploit Path
1. Call the misnamed `Fal1out()` function with a 0 value payload.
2. The function executes `owner = msg.sender` without any access control checks, instantly granting absolute ownership to the caller.

### Execution
```bash
forge script script/02-Fallout.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast
```
